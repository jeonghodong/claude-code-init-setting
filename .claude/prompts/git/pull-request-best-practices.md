# Pull Request Best Practices

Guidelines for creating, reviewing, and managing pull requests to ensure high-quality code and efficient collaboration.

## Pull Request Fundamentals

### What is a Pull Request?

A pull request (PR) is a proposal to merge code changes from one branch into another. It enables:
- Code review and collaboration
- Discussion of implementation details
- Quality checks (tests, linting, etc.)
- Documentation of changes
- Knowledge sharing across team

### When to Create a PR

**Create PR when**:
- Feature is complete and tested
- Bug fix is ready for review
- Refactoring is done
- Documentation needs review
- Code is ready for feedback

**Don't create PR when**:
- Work is not started yet
- Code doesn't compile/run
- Tests are failing (unless asking for help)
- Placeholder code without implementation

## Creating Great Pull Requests

### PR Title

Follow Conventional Commits format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

**Examples**:
```
‚úÖ Good:
feat: add user authentication with OAuth2
fix: resolve memory leak in data processing
docs: update API documentation for v2
refactor: simplify database query logic

‚ùå Bad:
Update files
WIP
fix
changes
```

## PR Size Guidelines

### Optimal PR Size

**Small PR (< 200 lines)**:
- ‚úÖ Easy to review thoroughly
- ‚úÖ Quick turnaround
- ‚úÖ Lower chance of bugs
- ‚úÖ Easier to revert if needed

**Medium PR (200-400 lines)**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Still reviewable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May take 30-60 minutes to review
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider splitting if possible

**Large PR (> 400 lines)**:
- ‚ùå Hard to review well
- ‚ùå Review fatigue
- ‚ùå High chance of missing issues
- ‚ùå **Should be split into smaller PRs**

### How to Keep PRs Small

```bash
# Bad: One massive PR
git checkout -b feature/complete-user-system
# ... 2000 lines of changes ...
git push -u origin feature/complete-user-system

# Good: Multiple focused PRs
git checkout -b feature/user-model
# ... add user model (100 lines) ...
git push -u origin feature/user-model
# Create PR #1

git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
# ... add auth (150 lines) ...
git push -u origin feature/user-authentication
# Create PR #2 (depends on PR #1)

git checkout -b feature/user-profile-ui
# ... add UI (200 lines) ...
git push -u origin feature/user-profile-ui
# Create PR #3 (depends on PR #2)
```

### Splitting Large PRs

**Strategies**:
1. **By layer**: Database ‚Üí API ‚Üí UI
2. **By feature**: Core logic ‚Üí Edge cases ‚Üí Polish
3. **By file type**: Models ‚Üí Controllers ‚Üí Views
4. **By risk**: Low-risk changes ‚Üí High-risk changes

## PR Review Process

### For Authors

**Before Creating PR**:
```bash
# 1. Ensure branch is up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/my-feature
git rebase main

# 2. Run all checks locally
npm run lint
npm run type-check
npm test
npm run build

# 3. Self-review changes
git diff main...HEAD

# 4. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/my-feature
gh pr create --fill
```

**Creating PR**:
1. Write clear title and description
2. Add relevant labels (bug, feature, documentation)
3. Assign reviewers
4. Link related issues
5. Add to project board (if applicable)

**During Review**:
1. Respond to all comments
2. Make requested changes
3. Push updates
4. Re-request review when ready
5. Resolve conversations when addressed

**Responding to Feedback**:
```markdown
‚úÖ Good responses:
- "Good catch! Fixed in abc123"
- "Changed to use Array.map() as suggested"
- "I kept this approach because [explanation]. Let me know if you disagree"
- "Created issue #456 to track this separately"

‚ùå Bad responses:
- "No"

### Review Comment Categories

Use labels to indicate priority:

**üî¥ BLOCKER**: Must fix before merge
```
üî¥ BLOCKER: SQL Injection Risk
This query concatenates user input directly. Use parameterized queries instead.
```

**üü° SUGGESTION**: Should fix (not blocking)
```
üü° SUGGESTION: Extract Complex Logic
Consider extracting this 50-line function into smaller, focused functions.
```

**üü¢ NITPICK**: Optional improvements
```
üü¢ NITPICK: Minor style inconsistency
Missing space after comma (line 45).
```

**üí° LEARNING**: Educational comment
```
üí° LEARNING: FYI
You could use Array.includes() here instead of indexOf() !== -1 for better readability.
```

**üëç PRAISE**: Acknowledge good work
```
üëç PRAISE: Excellent error handling!
I really like how you handled all edge cases here.
```

### Review Best Practices

**DO ‚úÖ**:
1. **Review promptly** (within 24 hours)
2. **Be constructive** ("Consider..." not "Wrong!")
3. **Explain reasoning** (WHY, not just WHAT)
4. **Praise good solutions**
5. **Ask questions** instead of demands
6. **Provide examples** of suggestions
7. **Focus on important issues** first
8. **Test locally** if needed

**DON'T ‚ùå**:
1. **Nitpick everything** (use automated tools)
2. **Be vague** ("This is bad")
3. **Demand perfection** (accept good enough)
4. **Bikeshed** (argue over trivial preferences)
5. **Review while rushed**
6. **Only criticize** (acknowledge good parts too)
7. **Block for trivial issues**
8. **Rubber stamp** without actually reading

## Draft PRs

### When to Use Draft PRs

**Use draft PR for**:
- Early feedback on approach
- Work in progress (WIP)
- Asking questions about implementation
- Showing progress to stakeholders

**Example**:
```markdown
## [DRAFT] Experiment: New caching strategy

This is a proof-of-concept for implementing Redis caching.

### Questions:
- Should we cache at the API level or database level?
- What should be the default TTL?
- How to handle cache invalidation?

### TODO:
- [ ] Add cache invalidation logic
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Add documentation
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
```

### Converting Draft to Ready

```bash
# When ready for review
gh pr ready
```

## PR Labels

### Standard Labels

| Label | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `bug` | Bug fixes | Fixing a defect |
| `feature` | New features | Adding functionality |
| `enhancement` | Improvements | Enhancing existing features |
| `refactoring` | Code refactoring | Restructuring code |
| `documentation` | Docs only | Documentation changes |
| `performance` | Performance improvements | Optimizations |
| `security` | Security fixes | Security vulnerabilities |
| `breaking-change` | Breaking changes | API changes |
| `dependencies` | Dependency updates | Updating packages |
| `wip` | Work in progress | Not ready for review |
| `needs-review` | Needs review | Ready for reviewers |
| `needs-testing` | Needs testing | Requires QA testing |
| `do-not-merge` | Do not merge | Blocked |

## Merging Pull Requests

### Merge Strategies

**1. Merge Commit** (Default)
```bash
git merge --no-ff feature/my-feature
```
- ‚úÖ Preserves full history
- ‚úÖ Clear when feature was merged
- ‚ùå More commits in history
- **Use for**: Features, significant changes

**2. Squash and Merge**
```bash
git merge --squash feature/my-feature
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication"
```
- ‚úÖ Clean history (one commit per feature)
- ‚úÖ Easier to revert
- ‚ùå Loses commit details
- **Use for**: Small features, bug fixes

**3. Rebase and Merge**
```bash
git rebase main
git checkout main
git merge feature/my-feature
```
- ‚úÖ Linear history
- ‚úÖ No merge commits
- ‚ùå Can be confusing
- **Use for**: Simple changes, clean commits

### When to Use Each Strategy

| Strategy | Best For | Avoid For |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Merge commit | Large features, multiple contributors | Small fixes |
| Squash | Small features, messy commits | Large features with good commit history |
| Rebase | Linear history preference | Complex merges, shared branches |

## After Merging

### Clean Up

```bash
# Delete local branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/my-feature

# Delete remote branch (usually automatic)
git push origin --delete feature/my-feature
```

### Post-Merge Checklist

- [ ] Branch deleted (local and remote)
- [ ] Deployment successful (if auto-deploy)
- [ ] Monitor for issues in production
- [ ] Close related issues
- [ ] Update project board
- [ ] Notify stakeholders (if needed)

## Common PR Issues

# Resolve conflicts
# Edit conflicted files
git add .
git rebase --continue

# Force push (branch only)
git push --force-with-lease
```

### Issue: Failed CI Checks

**Solution**:

**Solution**:
```bash
# Update from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/my-feature

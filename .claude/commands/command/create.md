**Command Description**: $1

Create a comprehensive Claude Code command system based on the description above. This includes:

1. **Agent**: A specialized agent that handles this specific task
2. **Prompt**: Supporting documentation in `.claude/prompts/` for best practices
3. **Skill**: A discoverable skill that Claude can invoke autonomously

# Command Creation Workflow

## Step 1: Analysis

Analyze the command description and determine:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this solve?
- **Category**: Which category does this belong to? (front-end, back-end, QA, devops, data, ai-ml, etc.)
- **Name**: Create a kebab-case name (e.g., `database-migrator`, `api-tester`)
- **Scope**: What specific tasks should this handle?
- **Context**: When should Claude use this?

## Step 2: Create Agent

Create an agent file at `.claude/agents/[name].md` with:

```markdown
---
name: [agent-name]
description: [Clear description of when to use this agent with 2-3 examples]
model: sonnet
color: [purple|blue|green|orange|red|yellow]
---

You are a specialized expert in [domain]. Your mission is to [primary goal].

- [Related prompt 2]: \`@.claude/prompts/[category]/[file].md\`

## Auto-Loading

This prompt is automatically loaded when task keywords include:
- "[keyword 1]"
- "[keyword 2]"
- "[keyword 3]"
```

**Prompt Categories**:

- `core/` - Universal principles (execution, agentic patterns, tool engineering, complexity, automation, MCP)
- `domain/` - Task-specific (coding, debugging, architecture, performance, deployment)
- `quality/` - Quality assurance (testing, security, code review)
- `git/` - Version control (commits, branches, PRs, workflow, merges)
- `front-end/` - Frontend development (components, state, styling, performance, accessibility)
- `back-end/` - Backend development (API, auth, database, error handling, performance)
- `devops/` - DevOps practices (deployment, CI/CD, monitoring, infrastructure)
- `data/` - Data engineering (pipelines, processing, analysis, warehousing)
- `ai-ml/` - AI/ML (models, training, evaluation, deployment)
- `QA/` - Quality assurance (testing, automation, documentation)

## Step 4: Create Skill

Use the `/skills:create` command to create the skill:

```bash
/skills:create [Description based on the original command description, with specific focus on when Claude should invoke this skill and what it should do]
```

The skill description should include:
- What the skill does
- When Claude should use it (trigger keywords)
- What specific actions it performs

## Step 5: Update CLAUDE.md (if needed)

If this is a new category or requires special auto-loading rules, update the Auto-Loading Rules table in `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
| "[keyword]", "[keyword2]" | \`@.claude/prompts/[category]/[name].md\` |
```

## Step 6: Verification

After creating all components, verify:

1. **Agent file exists**: `.claude/agents/[name].md`
   - Valid YAML frontmatter
   - Clear description with examples
   - Comprehensive agent instructions

2. **Prompt file exists**: `.claude/prompts/[category]/[name].md`
   - Organized in correct category
   - Follows best practices template
   - Includes concrete examples

3. **Skill created**: Check output from `/skills:create`
   - SKILL.md has proper frontmatter
   - Description includes trigger keywords
   - Instructions are clear and actionable

4. **Integration**: Ensure all three components work together:
   - Agent references the prompt document
   - Skill can invoke the agent
   - Prompt provides detailed guidelines

## Output

After creation, provide:

```markdown
## ‚úÖ Command System Created

### üìÅ Files Created

1. **Agent**: \`.claude/agents/[name].md\`
   - Purpose: [Brief description]
   - Color: [color]

2. **Prompt**: \`.claude/prompts/[category]/[name].md\`
   - Category: [category]
   - Auto-loads on: [keywords]

3. **Skill**: \`.claude/skills/[name]/SKILL.md\`
   - Trigger: [when to use]

### üöÄ Usage

**Autonomous**: Claude will automatically use this when you mention [trigger keywords]

**Explicit**: You can also use:
- \`/[command-name]\` (if slash command created)
- Directly mention the skill by name
- Invoke the agent via Task tool

### üìù Next Steps

1. Test the command by mentioning: "[example trigger phrase]"
2. Review and customize the prompt if needed
3. Share with team via git commit

### üîó Integration

- Agent references: \`@.claude/prompts/[category]/[name].md\`
- Auto-loading keywords: [list]
```
